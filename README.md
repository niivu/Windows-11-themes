A collection of 	**Windows 11 (22H2) Themes** to customize your desktop experience.  Including Themes, Wallpapers, Icons and more!
Warning:  If you are new to this or unsure it's always best to create a [System Restore Point](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/system-restore-point#:~:text=A%20system%20restore%20point%20is,of%20the%20System%20Properties%20window.) before continuing.
(You can check which version of Windows you are running by pressing Windows+R and typing 'winver' in the run dialog.)

## PATCH YOUR SYSTEM TO USE THIRD PARTY THEMES! 🚧
(Refer to the FAQ on their respective pages for any issues you may run into.)

[UltraUXThemePatcher](https://mhoefs.eu/software_uxtheme.php?lang=en) by Manuel Hoefs - modifies your system files so that 3. party themes can be used.  The program backups the original system files and all changes can be undone by uninstalling if you have issues.

::or::

[SecureUXTheme](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme) by namazso - is a software that removes signature verification of styles from Windows.
- No system file modifications
- No driver needed
- Secure boot compatible
- Probably quite future-proof
- Fixes LogonUI resetting some colors on locking

## APPLYING THIRD PARTY THEMES! 🎨
In order to apply custom themes you'll need to extract them and copy both the .theme files and the theme folder which has the name of the theme to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes. If you are using UltraUXThemePatcher then you'll just need to go to Settings > Personalization > Themes and apply the theme. If you are using SecureUXTheme, refer to the site's guide.
